# CarCountingDetection


The project presents a way to detect vehicles using Haarcascades. 
First we presented different vision based vehicle detection systems. Following that we presented a machine learning based technique to detect cars from video frames
. The hear feature based solution is faster and capable of detecting cars at a rapidly changing environment.
Experimental results show that the accuracy of counting vehicles is above 90%. The cost of sensors, processors and CCTV cameras are decreasing rapidly. 
This continued with increased image resolution provides the basis for a continuous growth of this field.
